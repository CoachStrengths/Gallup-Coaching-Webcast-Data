    "Description": "On a recent Called to Coach, we spoke with Gallup-Certified Strengths Coach Michael Dauphinee, who operates his own consulting company and travels the world to do that. Our conversation was hosted by Gallup's Jeremy Pietrocini. During almost two decades, Michael has been a Strengths Coach in a variety of corporate and nonprofit settings, nationally and internationally.\n\nBelow is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nGuest host Jeremy Pietrocini: In your own words, tell us about your journey of being called to coach and what you do in your day-to-day business.\n\nMichael Dauphinee: I worked at Hewlett-Packard as an international negotiator for 6 years. I got into a bit of a 9-to-5 rut, was involved with a nonprofit in San Diego when CliftonStrengths had launched. It was around 2000, and no one really knew what “StrengthsFinder” was. We started using StrengthsFinder with our volunteers, it became the language we spoke.\n\nWhen I turned 30, I had a moment (it’s in my new book, Extraordinary, comes out Sept. 4) that made me realize that what I was doing wasn’t my life, I needed to do something different. I realized that StrengthsFinder showed me my strengths, but they were what I had been spending the majority of my life trying to “scoop out of me.” A year later, I walked away from HP and spent a year traveling the U.S. and Western Europe talking about strengths with nonprofits and community leaders. My hope was that someday I could do workshops and make a full-time living out of strengths."

Our conversation was hosted by Gallup's own Claire DeCarteret from Gallup's Sydney, Australia, office. Andrew has a passion to use technology to benefit humans in what he calls the \"faster future,\" and in his strengths coaching practice he combines strengths and therapy as he works with individuals and teams.\n\nBelow is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nGuest host Claire DeCarteret: Tell us about yourself, your back story.\n\nAndrew Sloan: My Top 5 come into the room as soon I enter it, when I meet you. But it’s my “Back 5” (the next 5) are the engine room that allow me to offer my gifts to people. Those Back 5 are Belief, Connectedness, Responsibility, Empathy, and Arranger. Arranger really influences a lot of my Top 10.\n\nMy journey with strengths started about 4 years ago. I was angry and frustrated with life; my Top 5 weren’t being served, even though I didn’t know them yet. I found a strengths-based coach and therapist who I still work with today and we started to explore what my frustration might mean in light of my top capabilities."

This is part 2 of that discussion.\n\nWhat has changed since 2016? A lot of the focus on basic strengths education is naming, claiming, and aiming. Coaches are discovering that basic strengths education is necessary in order to inject strengths into organizations; a way of inviting them into the world of strengths.\n\nGallup is making CliftonStrengths 34 and enhancements more widely available, and people need to understand how to name, claim and aim their strengths. An e-learning module on the basics will be available in the fall to provide some introductory material, to help people get started. (This module doesn't replace a half-day or daylong coaching course.)"

One of his primary concerns for managers is one that he’s experienced himself: How many well-intentioned team leaders are there who are working really hard but don’t have any coaching or context about engagement and how do they lead to engagement through their strengths?\n\nIn this session, Mike talks about Q03 -- \"At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.\" Below is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nHost Jim Collison: Mike, welcome back to Called to Coach.\n\nGuest host Mike McDonald: Yeah, Jim, it’s been a whole week!\n\nJC: We’re talking Q03 today, so let’s dig in to that. What’s the question, and give us an overview.\n\nMM: The question itself is, “At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.” So you can hear already the strengths overtones in that question.\n\nWe want to refer to the resources that integrate with this discussion. First, Break All the Rules is the seminal study of engagement that contains a CliftonStrengths code and a Q12 code (for administering the 12 engagement items to a group of up to 10 people). We want to help this audience put these resources to work. I’ll also be referring to the book 12: The Elements of Great Managing, plus our State of the American Workplace report, our Millennials report and our Re-Engineering Performance Management report.\n\nWe want through these resources to add power to our coaching and consulting to get our clients closer to performance."

    "Description": "On this Theme Thursday Season Four webcast, Jim Collison, Gallup's Director of Talent Sourcing, and Maika Leibbrandt, Senior Workplace Consultant, talk about Competition.\n\nThe essence of Competition is comparison driven performance. Those high in Competition are really driven to win. They do not just want to play, they want to be the best. It is an awareness of your competitors. Those high in Competition get energy just from the act of competing. They embrace the fact that they are performing, and their performance can get better when they are comparing it to other performers.\n\nWhen Competition is at its best they can keep the team or product relevant in the market. Competition is not just about getting lost on a goal that they thought was important. Because of that ability to look left and right, Competition keeps you relevant to your customers. It is about focusing not just what goes in, but also what comes out. You may be more willing to change your strategy if it is not working, because you are not only paying attention to the effort you are putting in, but what that is translating to. There is a finish line with Competition. It is not good enough to just give good effort, you have to be the best.\n\nLook for tasks and projects that are measured against others. Look for it where it already exists. Even if you are doing something new and creative, think about who you are going to compete with. Think about looking for categories around Competition that will be relevant to your performance. Pay attention to specialization. Take on challenges that really require the skills, expertise, and experience that you have. Ask yourself what your niche is."

It’s been three years of intense application, and I’m feeling very much at peace with myself.\n\nPL: Tell me a little bit about what you’ve been doing. What has been your focus?\n\nV: I coach for the joy of coaching, and draw inspiration from coaching. I coach one-on-ones, I coach teams and I coach groups.

They are thoughtful, considerate, aware, and really tuned in to what’s going on. It is about minimizing risk at all costs. It’s wanting to jump, and knowing that when you’re jumping that nobody is going to fall. When somebody with high Deliberative is at their best their diligence and decision making brings confidence. They are up for making choices, especially choices that matter. Individuals with high Deliberative enjoy the process of sorting through options to move things forward. When they are at their best they are anticipating obstacles and preventing mistakes.\n\nIf you are high in Deliberative get involved in big decisions. Raise your hand for being involved in sorting through options. Sort through the existing evidence to make the best decision moving forward. Ask early and often for as many details as are currently available. Ask for the agenda. Ask for the enrollment data for students. Ask what expectations are expected of you early and often. Slowing things down is a by-product for the amount of time and consideration Deliberative puts into things."

What are you hoping to accomplish through the next 12 sessions (each of which is devoted to one of the 12 questions?\n\nMike McDonald: The first thing I want to do is to bring the importance of coaching to the leaders of teams if they want to be effective at driving engagement and performance in their teams. Leader self-awareness is critical, and that’s backed up by empirical research. The leader has to be in tune with the people they lead and the culture they’re creating and the performance that’s expected, nothing happens. And to have a coach for the leader is a game changer.\n\nThe other thing is to add aspects of coaching acumen to what we already know about great coaching. There are three points I’d like to land on:\n\nThe empirical matters -- this is truth, not just someone’s good idea.\n\nEngagement is predominantly emotional. We never want to get rid of the emotional. We want to capture and create the power of emotion.\n\nThe experiential -- we have all been in the three engagement categories, engaged, not engaged and actively disengaged."

The following is a summary of the conversation between Jim Collison and Traci.\n\nJim: Let’s talk about your journey to coaching.\n\nTraci: I’m based in Waterloo, in eastern Iowa, and my background is in HR and I have a master’s in counseling/psych from the University of Kansas. I focused on career and vocation in my grad school work. Back then, I wanted people to be happy at work, but now I know that engagement is more than just being happy. In those days of reading and studying what that looks like, all things pointed to Gallup. So I finished my master’s degree, did a little recruiting and then spent four years at Accenture in talent and organization performance in Kansas City.\n\nWe decided to move to Iowa and that led me to find my way locally and piece together a few things. I’ve taught for John Deere for about seven years as a contractor and then when I saw Gallup open the doors to becoming certified in Strengths and go deliver this, I thought, “Well, that seems like what I’ve been on this track to do for 15 years without knowing it.” I went through the training in March 2014 and was so blessed to have learned from Curt Liesveld and Heather Wright, and there were people in the room who were doing this full-time and I thought, “I want to do this full-time.” So today my focus is on Strengths workshops and training sessions, and using Q12 around engagement. 90% of my work comes from leading team sessions and workshops, and about 10% from coaching, mostly about career and transition, including college students."

It is the ability to see where things are not equal, and bring them into balance. People with high Consistency are good at setting up clear rules based on what works, and then following them. It is about getting things done not just for efficiency’s sake, but also in a fair way that understands that there are reasons we follow rules.\n\nIf you have high Consistency the value you bring is establishing stability through predictability. It is about following rules that make sense, not just creating rules. You really understand what promotes equality, and are able to translate that into something you do all the time. Consistency at its best is going beyond that awareness of when things are unfair and unbalanced, but following through with an internal nudge to take this outside of yourself. You are able to steer your organization and your family towards a more justified approach. Consistency does what works because it works over and over again. Consistency is about giving everyone the same starting point."

He found he enjoyed working with servicepeople and U.S. service academy graduates (West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Coast Guard Academy), especially those who are building a business. He understood their background because he has a similar background and because they are dependable. There are probably about 150,000 of them worldwide and about 10% are entrepreneurs, so a target market of 15,000 people.\n\nHe launched his current coaching business about a year ago via a podcast of successful entrepreneurs who were also service academy graduates and built an email list of service academy grads and let them know about the podcasts. After five months, he started his coaching program. He now has four coaches in his group and has six programs online (two of which are new this summer) and has signed up 30 clients during the past four months.\n\nSo he focused on a “super-tight niche,” which helped him build his business and then teaming up with others who have different skill sets that complement his. His coaching website is https://sabmgroup.com. He also sells mugs, t-shirts and other CliftonStrengths-related goods at his website, https://strengthsmugs.com."
