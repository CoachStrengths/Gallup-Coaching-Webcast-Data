YK has had two decades of IT consulting experience globally, working in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, in various roles that include sales to innovation lead. YK is a Certified Gallup Strengths Coach who is looking to pursue full-time strengths coaching and consulting, and is based in Hyderabad, India.\n\nBelow is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nOur host was Pooja Luthra, Advanced Consultant and Practice Expert with Gallup India.\n\nYK: After receiving training about 2 Â½ years ago, I looked at my strengths report. It gave me some ideas about my strengths in the areas of Input and Intellection. The report said I had a lot of ideas, and that I should start writing and sharing my ideas with others. Before that, I had the idea that I wanted to write but never did anything about that.\n\nOn May 1, 2017, Labor Day in India, I went to Facebook and decided to do some blogging, based on Gallup telling me that I should share my ideas and thoughts. Since then, I have written 200 blogs. It all started with the one or two lines in the strengths report that said I had something I should start sharing with others."

Sue has worked with engagement and with strengths, and Nearmap seeks to develop a high-performance, strengths-based culture.\n\nBelow is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nSue joined Nearmap two years ago. The company, an entrepreneurial small business, had a lot of staff who joined in one role but then pivoted and ended up doing something else for the business. The company wanted to put the right foundation in place to support its staff. The company looked into other engagement surveys that were quite long and didn't have much impact and realized that they needed to find a survey that was \"short and sharp\" and that the company could use to impact its workforce. Sue already had a relationship with Gallup and felt comfortable implementing the Q12 at Nearmap."

Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nThe CliftonStrengths Summit is scheduled for June of this year (it's been in July in other years), so if July hasn't worked for you but June does, be sure to put the summit on your calendar this year and attend.\n\nAbout 100 coaches are currently using the Coaches Insight Report (CIR), and automation of the report is coming. If you're not using the CIR, consider using it and check with some of the coaches who are using it.\n\nGallup is looking for \"studentpreneurs\" in 20 cities across Nebraska to take the BP10 assessment -- not just high school students, but college students too. And coaches can take this into their states too, and it would be good if this could be in conjunction with a university.\n\nBP10 is something that can be incorporated into people's transitional stages in life (in higher ed, moving into a career, changing careers, leaving the military, even release from prison, and so on)."

And this is part of the invitation that we get to say \"Yes\" to. We can go on forever in the discovery aspect of it.\n\nStrengths and engagement put people in control of the destiny of their lives, including in the classroom and academic setting.\n\nWe're going to look at what I (Jim Collison) have done on college campuses -- the University of Maryland and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. In these classrooms, they took CliftonStrengths and Q12, and we administered them this year in Lincoln in the middle of the semester (midterms), when stress was greater. We have also done it in the context of team formations, in technology-related fields.\n\nThere are many resources available for you on the Q12 site, and you can go back to the videos Mike and I (Jim) have made."

He assists people in transforming their organizational cultures into thriving workplaces, which means embedding strengths into daily conversations and changing the mindsets of managers so they see their employees more as people rather than as \"widgets.\"\n\nBelow is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nIn all of my (Peter's) career, I've been involved with bringing change into organizations. In some companies and teams, it was super frustrating; in others, it was great. Ten or 15 years ago, the enigma I faced was how to unlock the power of teams and of people. It became evident that whatever the vision was, it was about people.\n\nI came across Gallup in 2014, and it became clear to me that there are workplace needs (Q12) that people need to have satisfied. And there is something called strengths that focuses on how people can thrive. And it became clear to me that this is the solution for the future.\n\nSo we started thinking about how we can bring this to the organization, and it was extremely important to me to know how to solve the problem of \"stickiness\" -- how can we ensure that whatever we bring into a company will endure? It is frustrating to have a workshop with a particular team, get them inspired at the moment, and then come back two weeks later and there's no sign that the workshop ever happened. We found that CEOs and HR people are used to this kind of \"flavor of the month\" mentality, and we knew that we needed to embed this and make it stick."

Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nResources:\n\nFirst, Break All the Rules -- which has a CliftonStrengths code and a Q12 code for teams of up to 10 people.\n\n12: The Elements of Great Managing -- which brings each of the workplace items to life.

Are your best days ahead of you or behind you? As leaders and coaches, how do we help people stay out in front and cast a vision for the future? Again, \"hope\" is important in this item.\n\nWhy is it important that employees have hope? \"Hope\" in the workplace is an uncomfortable word; we think of it in other contexts (such as family) but have a hard time thinking of it in the workplace context.\n\nEngagement involves the conversion of emotion into performance. Hope helps us extend our voluntary, discretionary effort. It can give us resilience in our work, and can work together with the expectations item (Q01) and the supervisor cares item (Q05). All 11 items (Q01-Q11) contribute to the hope we have at work. And hope is contagious.\n\nHope is not some kind of magical word; it involves a confidence that today can be better than yesterday. Learning and growing (item Q12) is not just something that involves special opportunities to learn, like seminars or college courses, but is something far more daily -- what is my role, and is it getting better?"

She uses the science of well-being to improve the performance of leaders and organizations. Her expertise in the areas of positive psychology and well-being, as well as in strengths coaching (she is a Gallup-Certified Strengths Coach), has broad application to organizations and individuals.\n\nBelow is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nPositive psychology -- inherent in this discipline is a strengths-based approach. It takes a rigorous, scientific approach to what makes life makes living. About 20 years ago, Martin Seligman (President of the American Psychological Association) put out a \"call to arms\" invitation, saying we know a lot about what makes life difficult, but very little about what makes life worth living and allows people to thrive.\n\nWe now call it the science of well-being, which has application across health, business and education.\n\nIn a conversation I (Anne Lingafelter, host) had recently with Dr. Seligman, he said, \"If I'm the father of positive psychology, Don Clifton is the grandfather of positive psychology.\"\n\nAt a practical level, we can ask people, \"Do you think you perform better when you're feeling well, or when you're not having a great day?\" We know from our own lives, when we feel well, we do better."

That's when strengths can become especially powerful.\n\nBelow is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nHow can we use strengths as a business strategy?\n\nTalent identification is the first step (naming)\n\nTalent awareness and appreciation is the second (claiming) -- this is where people and organizations get \"stuck\" (and don't move on to the third step)\n\nTalent application and development (aiming) -- this is the key piece for people and organizations\n\nCliftonStrengths is a grassroots movement, but leaders need to get \"bought into\" strengths early in the process. Leaders need to see how strengths can have an impact on their organization's success. Building a strengths-based culture involves enhancing people's ability to deliver consistent, near-perfect performance in a specific task. This means strengths become integral in the way employees interact with each other and the way they get work done (not something they do \"on top of\" their work)."

We've been moving in a journey through being a team member (Qs07-10) to now taking on the mindset of an organization member. We can't feel good if our company isn't doing well as an organization.\n\nThis item relates to hope -- it has a \"future lean\" that makes me want to see a horizon, and to have a leader who helps me see it. Hope is one of the most underused concepts in the workplace, and it does make a difference between someone staying and someone leaving."

Use this question to your advantage.\n\nThis is a powerful, thought-provoking question that not only provides clarity but also discovery. So we confirm some things but find some things we haven't seen before.\n\nThere is so much psychologically and relationally that we need from our workplaces as represented by Q10. The motivational request behind this item is, \"Help me build mutual trust.\" If people at work have your back, with unconditional trust, think about the freedom you have to deliver world-class performance. If you don't have that, there's a hesitation and a withholding of effort."

I'm really excited to be a part of it, and I genuinely love talking about this material.\n\nAL: The not-for-profit that you're working for is a community housing organization in Sydney and that you're developing and managing sustainable, safe and affordable homes, and working in partnership to create a vibrant and inclusive community. Obviously the not-for-profit space has some unique challenges, and I'm sure we'll be able to address those.\n\nBut I want to go back to the beginning and talk about how you first came across the Q12 instrument.\n\nEC: Absolutely. So I was first exposed to the Q12 early in my career, when I was working as part of a large financial services organization, and we rolled that out as our annual employee engagement instrument. And I instantly connected and related to it -- it was simple and easy to grasp, but yet short and succinct. It was something that could be a pro forma for leadership and team membership."

Full audio and video are\n\nposted above.\n\nHost Jim Collison: Mike McDonald is our host today. He works as a Senior Workplace Consultant here on the Riverfront. Mike, welcome back to another Called to Coach.\n\nGuest host Mike McDonald: We're ready to go, Jim. We're starting to get into the rarified air of the higher order of engagement. I think this is going to stretch all of us.\n\nJC: I agree with you. This is one of the first ones where it's not necessarily the manager or even the person. It really transcends the idea of even team. Talk about the question and the resources available.\n\nMM: Today we're talking about Q08 of our 12. It's \"The mission or purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important.\" It's interesting to think about the mission (or purpose) of my company -- one segment -- and then makes me feel my job is important. How do we drill down and make this statement come alive on a daily basis that will drive engagement?"

Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nHost Jim Collison: Mike McDonald is our host today. Mike, welcome to Called to Coach.\n\nGuest host Mike McDonald: Jim, it's kind of an adrenaline rush and ride.\n\nJC: This next question, Q07, and I say this about all of them, it's really important. When we think about employees and their opinions, this is really hard and at the same time really easy. One of the major parts of my job is to help people's opinions count. What is the full question and what does it mean?\n\nMM: Jim, should we have a moment -- we're celebrating a record. The U.S. is experiencing a tie for its all-time high of employee engagement. Drum roll . it's 34%. Ties our record high.\n\nJC: Mike, it's just one (percentage point) -- from 33% to 34%. What does that really represent?\n\nMM: We broke out our calculators and Googled some things, and found out there are 134 million workers in the U.S., so 1.3 million more people woke up this morning and were excited and looking forward to the work they were going to do and the people they were going to do it with.\n\nSo how do we make the 1.3 million tangible? Dallas has about 1.3 million people. Imagine the city of Dallas waking up and loving what they do and the people they're doing it with. It takes hundreds of millions of touchpoints to move the needle on that. So Jim and I are excited that we think we are trending, and maybe can take this country and planet toward a tipping point of engagement."

This item starts to sort true manager talent vs. managers who can (only) follow rules and guidance and instruction. This separates what we would call a \"great manager\" (from the rest)."

I got into a bit of a 9-to-5 rut, was involved with a nonprofit in San Diego when CliftonStrengths had launched. It was around 2000, and no one really knew what \"StrengthsFinder\" was. We started using StrengthsFinder with our volunteers, it became the language we spoke.\n\nWhen I turned 30, I had a moment (it's in my new book, Extraordinary, comes out Sept. 4) that made me realize that what I was doing wasn't my life, I needed to do something different. I realized that StrengthsFinder showed me my strengths, but they were what I had been spending the majority of my life trying to \"scoop out of me.\" A year later, I walked away from HP and spent a year traveling the U.S. and Western Europe talking about strengths with nonprofits and community leaders. My hope was that someday I could do workshops and make a full-time living out of strengths."

Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nJim Collison: We are going to cover Q01 today, which is \"I know what is expected of me at work,\" and we have some standard expectations to cover. Where are we going to go and what are we going to do?\n\nMike McDonald: Well, Jim, as we've established in the first call, we want to continue this outline of empirical -- emotional -- experiential. Empirical involves helping you stand on Gallup research so you know what is true. We want to make sure we don't miss the heart and soul of engagement, which is the emotional. And the experiential -- we want to share stories and case studies and examples that give us a personal connection. We want to keep those three in front of us."

And I think the reason is with every passing day that I use (CliftonStrengths) and the tools we have access to, my discovery of what we can do with it and the opportunities that unfold every day are limitless in the last 36 months of being a coach. It's been three years of intense application, and I'm feeling very much at peace with myself.\n\nPL: Tell me a little bit about what you've been doing. What has been your focus?\n\nV: I coach for the joy of coaching, and draw inspiration from coaching. I coach one-on-ones, I coach teams and I coach groups. My intent has been: 1) How can I maximize my \"reach\"? 2) How can I use this skill and these tools to get to know many people? I'm also now using this to see how I the \"reach\" I have can meet my objectives in what I do."

This series will be hosted by Dr. Mike McDonald, Senior Workplace Consultant at Gallup, who started at Gallup in 1990 as a manager/team leader and has had a variety of roles but has always led a team. One of his primary concerns for managers is one that he's experienced himself: How many well-intentioned team leaders are there who are working really hard but don't have any coaching or context about engagement and how do they lead to engagement through their strengths?\n\nBelow is a summary of the conversation. Full audio and video are posted above.\n\nJim: Strengths are infinitely more powerful in the context of a measurement called Q12 (which has 12 questions). What are you hoping to accomplish through the next 12 sessions (each of which is devoted to one of the 12 questions?\n\nMike McDonald: The first thing I want to do is to bring the importance of coaching to the leaders of teams if they want to be effective at driving engagement and performance in their teams. Leader self-awareness is critical, and that's backed up by empirical research. The leader has to be in tune with the people they lead and the culture they're creating and the performance that's expected, nothing happens. And to have a coach for the leader is a game changer.\n\nThe other thing is to add aspects of coaching acumen to what we already know about great coaching. There are three points I'd like to land on:\n\nThe empirical matters -- this is truth, not just someone's good idea.\n\nEngagement is predominantly emotional. We never want to get rid of the emotional. We want to capture and create the power of emotion.\n\nThe experiential -- we have all been in the three engagement categories, engaged, not engaged and actively disengaged."

Traci is a Strengths Trainer, Engagement Consultant, and Career Coach who lives in Iowa.\n\nDuring the interview,  Traci shares how she has been putting her strengths to work amid a life crisis -- in her case, a cancer diagnosis. The following is a summary of the conversation between Jim Collison and Traci.\n\nJim: Let's talk about your journey to coaching.\n\nTraci: I'm based in Waterloo, in eastern Iowa, and my background is in HR and I have a master's in counseling/psych from the University of Kansas. I focused on career and vocation in my grad school work. Back then, I wanted people to be happy at work, but now I know that engagement is more than just being happy. In those days of reading and studying what that looks like, all things pointed to Gallup. So I finished my master's degree, did a little recruiting and then spent four years at Accenture in talent and organization performance in Kansas City.\n\nWe decided to move to Iowa and that led me to find my way locally and piece together a few things. I've taught for John Deere for about seven years as a contractor and then when I saw Gallup open the doors to becoming certified in Strengths and go deliver this, I thought, \"Well, that seems like what I've been on this track to do for 15 years without knowing it.\" I went through the training in March 2014 and was so blessed to have learned from Curt Liesveld and Heather Wright, and there were people in the room who were doing this full-time and I thought I want to do this full-time.\" So today my focus is on Strengths workshops and training sessions, and using Q12 around engagement. 90% of my work comes from leading team sessions and workshops, and about 10% from coaching, mostly about career and transition, including college students."

He found he enjoyed working with servicepeople and U.S. service academy graduates (West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Coast Guard Academy), especially those who are building a business. He understood their background because he has a similar background and because they are dependable. There are probably about 150,000 of them worldwide and about 10% are entrepreneurs, so a target market of 15,000 people.\n\nHe launched his current coaching business about a year ago via a podcast of successful entrepreneurs who were also service academy graduates and built an email list of service academy grads and let them know about the podcasts. After five months, he started his coaching program. He now has four coaches in his group and has six programs online (two of which are new this summer) and has signed up 30 clients during the past four months.\n\nSo he focused on a \"super-tight niche,\" which helped him build his business and then teaming up with others who have different skill sets that complement his. His coaching website is https://sabmgroup.com. He also sells mugs, t-shirts and other CliftonStrengths-related goods at his website, https://strengthsmugs.com."

Music fills me with positivity. Hillsong did recently win a Grammy. Their music is really about bringing people closer to God and we did not expect to see it have such a broad impact."

      "description": "On a recent Called to Coach, we spoke with the Principal Architect of Gallup's Global Learning Strategy, Dean Jones.\n\nWeaknesses - we all have a lot of them!\n\nDon Clifton quote - \"Focus on what's right\" - get interpreted as never think about weaknesses\n\nHistorical context - nascent age of psychology\n\nAny development journey includes an assessment (an accounting) of what's right and what's wrong, what's working and not working\n\nImportant component of growth is self-awareness.  Self-awareness is incomplete without an awareness or appreciation of weaknesses.\n\nSix assertions about weaknesses to inform the discussion:\n\nStrengths and weaknesses are not opposites.  You don't create a strength out of a weakness.\n\nStrengths are based on a repository of talent.  When you dig into a weakness, you seldom find a talent - you typically find an absence of talent.\n\nPeople often take their talent for granted - the fallacy of ease.  So they are inclined to invest in areas where things seem hard, assuming that mastering them will provide the great growth.\n\nThey think what comes easily must not be valuable, and what is hard and takes work is better.  Work at what comes easily.\n\nMastery is about capitalizing on talent, rather than overcoming the odds.\n\n\"Rudy\" is about a moment of victory, not a lifetime of success and accomplishment.  Where could you best apply yourself?  In the end, it's a sad story.\n\nYou can't \"fix\" a weakness.  There is really nothing to fix - nothing to work with.  You need to aware of it, account for it.\n\nLike driving around a barrier, rather than driving through it.\n\nWeaknesses don't really develop in the same way as strengths.  Strengths develop infinitely.\n\nThey develop incrementally - they don't have the same return.\n\nThey don't develop in the same fluid, intuitive fashion\n\nRhythm to a dancer\n\nMikaela Shifferin - \"just getting started\"\n\nWeaknesses get uncovered over time.\n\nCliftonStrengths is like a treasure map - it tells you where to start digging.  But experience and application over time give you real understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nYou might go back to the map to orient yourself, but you want to focus on the application and experience of talents to develop them.\n\nWeaknesses are relative. As you develop, yesterday's strengths are today's weaknesses.\n\nYou get narrow. You focus. That is the path to being world class.\n\nThe best get ruthless - honest, truthful - about their weaknesses, so they can keep focusing.\n\nMuch work of strengths coaches can be helping people become aware of their weaknesses and use their strengths to overcome them.\n\nUsually that means a strengths coaches need to help the person they are coaching with:\n\nBeing aware of their weaknesses\n\nBeing responsible for them\n\nUsing strengths-based strategies to manage them and produce results\n\nAwareness\n\nWeaknesses can often be in areas that are blind spots\n\nPeople may have a passing awareness of their weaknesses - but don't really see the impact\n\nAwareness-building often happens through a combination of receiving feedback and understanding impact\n\nDirect feedback is most valuable\n\nUnderstanding the impact on two levels - impact on others, and impact on self\n\nAwareness issues:\n\nClaiming strengths you don't have\n\nNot seeing weaknesses\n\nBeing unaware of your strengths\n\nBeing unaware of your non talents\n\nResponsible\n\nPeople who legitimately know their strengths tend to be more forthcoming with their weaknesses.\n\nFatal flaw is believing their strengths apply to everything (Icarus)\n\nYou can't make someone be responsible - they have to give it to themselves.  It is a process of taking ownership.\n\nNot about finding fault - it's about understanding that \"I have a say in the way this goes.\"\n\nStrengths-based Strategies\n\nIt only makes sense that the best way to apply yourself to addressing your weaknesses would be to use your areas of greatest talent.\n\nThat's why we look to our strengths as the best way to address weaknesses.\n\nStrategies for addressing weaknesses:\n\nCreate Open Dialogue and Transparency\n\nIntentionally Leverage your Strengths\n\nFind Support Systems\n\nBuild Complementary Partnerships\n\nGet the Right Education\n\nSet Reasonable Standards and Just Do It\n\nAdjust or Change Roles\n\nThis is not about inspiration.  This is not about \"believe in yourself.\"  This is about identifying and getting clear about your talent - and then putting it to work.\n\nJoin us at the 2018 CliftonStrengths Summit to learn more about improving your workplace through strengths.

You can begin to accurately identify and gauge your strengths without knowing and identifying those areas where you are weak.\n\nStrengths occur against a backdrop of weaknesses. It's like light and darkness - you can't distinguish one without the other.\n\nSo, ironically, weaknesses are a really important for strengths development."

It's not like \"I have this perspective\" - I think that the world is that way, and I don't really understand why others don't see it that way.\n\nSelf-awareness is our access to transforming our view of the world\n\nI become aware of the filter and can realize that there is something beyond it\n\nStill trapped by the filter - but I realize that something is missing\n\nThe paradox is that we are always \"trapped\" by who we are - we can never escape it.  We can only fully love and accept ourselves.  And that allows us to transcend our own humanity.  We are not just given by who we are - we can then see our identity at work (of which our talents and strengths are a part) and extend beyond it.\n\nGet interested in how something/someone else might complement me.  Understand the limits of my own abilities, talents, strengths and humanity.\n\nCoaching is a process of building self-awareness."

We will structure this program as we go through the season a lot like Theme Thursday. Today we will be talking about what the Builder Profile is. What is the tool? Where does it come from?\n\nBuilder Profile is the result of an initiative to try to understand the unique talents that people bring that have an entrepreneurial gift. These are people that don't just start things, but they build and sustain things. It is not just about innovation, but it is something that is created in which a customer will buy. This is something a business can be built around. The assessment was designed to discover this need, and in that discovery process we found that there are 10 Builder Talents that we focus on and what their intensity is for each of these. The great and successful builders of business possess, or account for, all 10 talents. Even if they do not possess all 10 Talents, they have the capacity to bring connections to help account for that portion of the business."

Define the difference between a strength, a talent and a theme and be sure you know them by heart. 3. Introduce the CliftonStrengths assessment and be able to talk about the validation of the assessment. 4. Help people name, claim and aim their talents. 5. Address how to handle weaknesses. In this webcast, Dean dives deeper into how to lead an effective training.\n\nHere are the 10 new tips Dean covers in this webcast:\n\n1. Prepare based on five perspectives:\n\nUnderstand the design of the course, get inside the integrity of the design and get the connection points, learn how it pieces together, the narrative and the flow.\n\nThink about the participant experience and what you want the outcome for them to be.\n\nHow will you deliver the course as a leader?\n\nConsider the logistics and the materials you will use. Remember not to give people materials until they need it, otherwise it is distracting.\n\nWhat is the intended impact? Participants need something they can take away and apply immediately."

While Gallup cherishes and celebrates that type of entrepreneurship, starting a company is only one manifestation of what EP10 is about. The talents in EP10 are really about building, whether building new companies or new services and products within existing companies. Gallup heard from enterprise clients who need innovators and intrepreneurs, they need all types of people with the talent to build.

After attending the 2016 CliftonStrengths Summit, Deon's strengths coaching took on a new shape. He realized lots of people were coaching teams, and he was asked if there was more of a niche where he saw a need. When he reflected on his time coaching teams, he realized dispersed teams could really use strengths to be more successful. He was so pleased with the CliftonStrengths Summit that he booked and paid for the 2017 Summit as soon as the invite came out!\n\nDeon knows how important understanding people is in order to achieve better processes. With teams, Deon uses Gallup's Q12 as the baseline, then introduces CliftonStrengths. This helps him understand how people on the team operate, and knowing the \"how\" of performance helps teams answer the question of \"who\" to use for processes."

Together, Jack and Jock plunged in and had three hectic weeks: setting up a dynamic website, recruiting their cohort of students for the pilot and getting three people through Gallup strengths coaching courses. They didn't know if they would make it, but as they explained, \"They told us we could fail and that was important.\" The idea that they could fail at launching this pilot program gave Jack and Jock permission to be creative in designing and launching Your Edge.\n\nBut, they didn't fail. Your Edge was a hit with its first two cohorts during the pilot phase. One thing that bound students to the program was the Clifton StrengthsFinder. Jack explained, \"It gave them a shared language and coaching on their strengths allowed the students to form a community.\" CliftonStrengths were particularly successful for students participating in Your Edge online. Jack and Jock explained that because those students don't congregate in a physical space, the need to engage them with their peers is imperative. CliftonStrengths gave those online students the tools to discuss \"...who they are and what made them tick and they started to open up to one another.\""

The next level is ignorance about their strengths, and the level above that is knowing their strengths but using them for entertainment only. Liz said, \"The final level is strengths mastery where people embrace their strengths and who they are.\" Pushing her clients to strengths mastery is rewarding for Liz. She explained that some barriers to moving along the strengths journey are: trying to be like other people and living in the basement of one's themes. Liz said her clients sometimes strive to be like others instead of becoming the best version of themselves. In doing so, they fail to rely on and embrace their natural themes, skills and talents. Also, in living in the basement of their strengths, some people may not understand how strengths can enhance their lives, instead of inhibiting their growth."

Gallup-Certified strengths coaches have a vested interest in understanding the pathway to strengths mastery. Understanding this path enables coaches to successfully coach their clients in a profoundly meaningful and transformative way. This type of coaching goes beyond knowledge-based coaching and skills-building coaching to transcendent coaching, where clients have insights and epiphanies that change the way they see the world. There are six stages for strengths mastery. This webcast discusses the first three: Understanding, Awareness and Appreciation."

Yvette helps her clients fully understand their motivations, fears, talents and strengths with two tools: the Enneagram from the world of meta-coaching and neurosemantics, and Clifton StrengthsFinder from Gallup. Yvette explained, \"Both tools align beautifully\" because Enneagram identifies a person's core motivations and Clifton StrengthsFinder identifies how \"a person shows up in the world and the language for their behavior.\" For instance, Yvette's core motivation is \"...to have fun and freedom\" while her core fear is to be \"...trapped in boredom.\" Yvette's motivation and fear align well with her number one strength, Positivity."

But after being in the industry for almost ten years, he wasn't feeling fulfilled. He needed to really think about what he wanted out of his career and his life, so he took an eight month sabbatical to reflect on what to do. Richard had always been fascinated with helping others, so he started to meet friends and acquaintances over coffee to discuss what issues plagued them. It was then that he started informally coaching others.\n\nRichard expanded his coaching practice and began accepting clients. Two years ago, he discovered the Clifton StrengthsFinder and incorporated it into his coaching repertoire. Richard explained that StrengthsFinder helped him become a better leader, coach and \"talent spotter.\" Specifically, it helped him and others from getting mired in trying to fix weaknesses. Instead, he honed in on improving his strengths and using them every day.\n\nRichard also believes that coaches need to help their clients curb their hectic schedules by taking mini-sabbaticals and using the acronym STOP. STOP means to Step back, Think, and Organize your thoughts before you Proceed. This method helps clients evaluate their careers -- do they enjoy their work, or are there activities outside of work that they \"get lost in?\" STOP helps Richard's clients focus on the latter activities and turn those into the basis of a career.\n\nTo hear more about Richard and his coaching experiences and expertise, watch the video above.\n\nVisit Gallup Strengths Center to browse our myriad of products and learning opportunities for strengths-based development.\n\nContinue the coaching conversation on Facebook and Twitter.

Jamie suggests that, if you do feel as though it is too much information to take in at once, you approach it one strength at a time. There is no prescribed length of time that you should invest into each strength, but try owning your top strength first, and then moving on to the next one when you're ready."

He says that managers need to know their employees' strengths in order to place them in the right roles. For example, he explained that someone with Woo should be out talking to people and making sales instead of sitting behind a computer all day. On the other hand, someone with high Strategic Thinking themes like Analytical and Context should be working with numbers. When the right people are aligned with the right jobs, managers will see a noticeable improvement in employee morale and output."

Liesveld answered the call to coach after realizing his \"intense interest in the nature of human beings.\" Along with a sociology degree and a theology background, Liesveld uses the Clifton StrengthsFinder to study humans and transform their raw potential into talents at which they excel.\n\nLiesveld not only coaches individuals, he also coaches other strengths coaches who want to improve the wellbeing of others. He genuinely enjoys coaching others and seeing the impact strengths-based coaching can have on people's lives."
